# Todo App

Todo App is a fun little project I made, I decided to combine auth and a simple crud app to further expand my skills in web security.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
